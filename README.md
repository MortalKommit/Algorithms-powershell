#Algorithms with powershell

A collection of program modules that make use of algorithms for file retrieval,
string matching and other utility.

Get-DirectoryFiles retrieves files and folders as a stream, with a queue and a stack-based implementation
for recursively retrieving files within subsequent directories.


## TO ADD:
1. jacquard similarity for string matching
2. Backtracking algorithms to be used with directory for branch pruning
